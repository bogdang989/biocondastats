70	fastx_toolkit	37524	The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for
Short-Reads FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing.

Next-Generation sequencing machines usually produce FASTA or FASTQ files,
containing multiple short-reads sequences (possibly with quality
information).

The main processing of such FASTA/FASTQ files is mapping (aka aligning) the
sequences to reference genomes or other databases using specialized
programs. Example of such mapping programs are: Blat, SHRiMP, LastZ, MAQ
and many many others

However, it is sometimes more productive to preprocess the FASTA/FASTQ files
before mapping the sequences to the genome - manipulating the sequences to
produce better mapping results.

The FASTX-Toolkit tools perform some of these preprocessing tasks.'
